In a liberty - based nation like the United States , where we are free to fail and to suffer , that fortitude is a welcome and necessary attribute .

To admit we had control over that outcome would be to admit we failed , to admit we lost . And no one likes losing .

Careers have been ruined , relationships destroyed , Twitter accounts deleted , and lawsuits filed . Politics has become toxic and vindictive . Therapy visits have increased as depression diagnoses rise . Thoughtful conversations have been substituted by social media snark and insult , where your opponent is assumed to have the worst intentions — simply because they are an opponent . Fairness and due process have been supplanted by self - righteous hysteria and public shaming . The meme has replaced good argument , the tweet has replaced the well - reasoned op - ed , and the op - ed has replaced objective journalism . The result is nothing short of information chaos , a culture of contempt , and a deep sense of unhappiness that is blamed on everyone but ourselves .</h3>

The threat is born of small beginnings , as big threats so often are . It starts with toxic personal narratives wrapped in the cheap cloth of victimhood , always looking to an external culprit to blame for real or perceived injustices . At first , this blame is assigned to an individual — your unfair boss , your neglectful parent , a teacher who refused to see your potential , or just perpetual bad luck . But this isn’t enough for the outrage enthusiast . There must be more culprits . More oppressors to be blamed for your misfortune .</h3>

I do not run from pain but embrace it , because I derive strength from my suffering . I confront the inevitable trials of life with a smile . I plan to keep my head , to be still , when chaos overwhelms me . I will tell the story of my failures and hardships as a victor , not a victim . I will be grateful . Millions who have gone before me have suffered too much , fought too hard , and been blessed with far too little , for me to squander this life . So I won’t .
