# book-reviews

This project will be an opportunity for me to kill two birds with one stone. With one stone I will be practicing my web development skills, on the other I will be creating a catalog of my thoughts and notes on the books I've read. 

My thoughts on this project so far are mostly a static website consisting of HTML and CSS. I definitely need some practice with these technologies. 
I also want to design this "site" to be visually aesthetic and will be practicing my design skills.
